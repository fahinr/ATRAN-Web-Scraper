# ATRAN-Web-Scraper
A small script to obtain synthetic atmospheric spectra by filling in the needed parameters in the code and running it which will save the necessary file formats in the desired folders.

Simply fill out the necessary ATRAN form constants (Altitude, water vapor, resolution, etc), you will then be prompted to submit the wavelength range, (in the code itself, you can manually change the runtime inputs of the zenith angles, the number of files [linspace] for each, and the file path, etc.)

Overall, the script simply obtains the needed parameters, references the link and appends the URL, submits the parameters, and then downloads the output file.
Additional ML, PyTorch, and other peripheral software that was used along with this is proprietary.
